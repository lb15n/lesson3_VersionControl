            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Static web pages provide fixed content delivered directly to the user from the web-server's file-system, precisely as it is stored—that is until, if ever, the developer decides to alter its source code. Standard HTML pages are prime examples of a static web page, as they are designed with code that defines the structure and content of the web page.  Every time an HTML page is loaded it appears the sames to each of its users. Most often, you can easily identify a static webpage by viewing the page’s file extension in the URL, which is located in the address field of the web browser. Usually, an “.htm” or “.html” extension indicates that the page is most likely a static web page. Ideally, static web pages are presumably most suitable for contents in which never or seldomly ever require the need for an update. 
            Some of the benefits of a static web page includes: 1) It is extremely efficient; 2) It is exceptionally fast and quite easy to develop; and 3) It is customarily free or at least reasonably economical to develop and/or host. Some examples of ideal contenders for static websites are blogs, resumes, marketing websites, and landing pages.

                <span class="text-muted">Dynamic Web Page</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Dynamic web pages generate live (real-time) content on the server per each demand/request which is delegated to a flowing web-application server processing server-side scripts to develop content. Dynamic web pages differ from static web pages because they have the ability to produce assorted content for different visitors using the same source code file. Some of the factors that may result in varying displays of web content may be relative to the type of operating system, computing device, or web browser used by the visitor. Most often, you can easily identify a dynamic webpage by viewing the page’s file extension in the URL, which is located in the address field of the web browser.  Usually, an “.asp”, “.jsp” or “.php” extension indicates that the page is most likely a dynamic web page, as they contain "server-side" code that generates unique content. For example, the server may display the current time and date on the web page. 
            Some of the benefits of a dynamic web page includes: 1) It allows multiple users to modify and update the content of a web page without altering the web layout; 2) It is fairly simpple to restructure which ensures its longevity; and 3) Only basic web design skills are needed to successfully edit web page content

            <p class="lead">The Internet Protocol (IP) is the method or protocol by which data is sent from one computer to another on the Internet. Each computer (known as a host) on the Internet has at least one IP address that uniquely identifies it from all other computers on the Internet.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A URL or Uniform Resource Locator is a form of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which is the common term defining the various types of names and addresses that refer to elements on the World Wide Web. The term "web address" is also a synonym for a URL that applies the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. The first part of a URL is known as the protocol identifier which specifies the appropriate protocol to use; then, the second part is called a resource name which identifies the IP address or the domain name where the resource is located. Additionally, the protocol identifier and the resource name are separated by a colon and two forward slashes.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Is the part of a network address that identifies it as belonging to a particular domain. Essentially, the domain name locates an organization or other entity on the Internet. Whenever you visit a website, the domain name appears in the address bar of the web browser. Some domain names are preceded by "www" (which is not part of the domain name), while others omit the "www" prefix. All domain names have a domain suffix, such as .com, .net, or .org. The domain suffix helps identify the type of website the domain name represents. For example, ".com" domain names are typically used by commercial website, while ".org" websites are often used by non-profit organizations. </p>
