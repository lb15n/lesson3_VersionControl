            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a key component of software configuration management that administers document changes and large websites, as well as computer programs and other collections of information.  Changes are typically recognized by a character such as a number or letter code, called the “revision number”, “revision level”, or simply put, just “revision”.  The term version control is interchangeably used with revision control or source control. Version control systems (VCS) are a category of software tool for helping a software team manage changes to source code over time.  Essentially their purpose is based on the concept of tracking changes that occur within directories or files. VCS’ are commonly operated as stand-alone applications, however, revision control is also embedded in many forms of software (e.g.: Google Docs and Sheets) and in several content management systems (CMS) (e.g.: a website’s page history)

                <span class="text-muted">Commit</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When working with files that are under version control, each change is automatically tracked. An example may be modification of a file, deletion of a directory, addition of a new file, relocations of a file or other factors that ultimately alter the original state of the file. Rather than tracking each change individually, the version control system will wait for the submission of changes as a solitary collection of actions which is known as a commit. Basically, in version control systems (VCS), a commit inserts the most recent revisions to the repository source code to, making such changes part of the head revision of the repository.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The primary purpose of a repository is to store a set of files in addition to the history of changes performed on those files. In revision control systems (RVS), a repository is an on-disk data structure which stores metadata for a collection of files and/or directory structure. Depending on whether the version control system in use is distributed (e.g.: Git) or centralized (e.g.: Subversion), the entire set of information in the repository may be duplicated on each user’s system or it can be maintained on a single server. Some examples of the metadata includes: (1) A historical documentation of changes in the repository; (2) A set of commit objects; and (3) A set of references to commit objects known as heads.

                <span class="text-muted">Branching</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A set of files under version control may be branched for a moment so that, from that period on, two copies of those files can generate at different momentums or in different variations independent of each other. The original branch is also known as the parent or upstream branch. Child branches have a parent branch, while branches without a parent are called the trunk or sometimes the mainline. In some revision control systems, obtaining a copy of a repository is the same concept as branching, which generally implies the ability to later merge or integrate changes onto the parent branch.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git was originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the world renowned creator of the Linux operating system kernel. It is an actively maintained, open source version control software that allows a team of developers to safely work together on the same project without interfering with each other, while simultaneously all using the same files. It also helps the team cope with the complexities that tends to occur when multiple people are editing the same files. Git simply works by taking screenshots of files. Git stores file content in binary large objects (BLOBS). Each folder is represented as tree and each tree contains other trees (subfolders) and BLOBs along with a simple text file that contains the mode, type, name and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) of each BLOB and subtree entry.</p>
